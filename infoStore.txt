My Student Profile:

About Me
Hello! Iâ€™m Zitang Ren, a Grade 10 Student taking the CIE IGCSE in SJII. In my downtime, I am often found programming. I â€˜enjoyâ€™ programming and web design, despite how tediously painful it is sometimes. Some of my projects (including the code for this website) can be found at my GitHub page. Yes, this website was built from scratch, by me, as well as the art for each title page. This is somewhat because I hope to one day work as a front-end developer, but also partly because itâ€™s a rewarding experience completing a big project such as this one. Iâ€™ve taken multiple out-of-school courses on Python (working with MatPlotLib, NumPy and Pandas), web development languages (JS API calls, basic design) as well as learning about computer science theory, such as neural networking and other fundamental knowledge. For now, I donâ€™t hold any significant qualifications, but I do intend on participating in the BrainHack 2022 hackathon, hosted by the Singaporean Governmentâ€™s Defence Science and Technology Agency in partnership with NUS.

IT Skills
Advanced knowledge of Google Workspace technology, as well as working with raw code itself. Very proficient using Docs, Slides, Sheets and other similar applications. Have experience working with Google Cloud Platform services and fundamental knowledge of most, such as Vertex AI and GCP hosted VMs. Less proficient using Microsoft products ðŸ˜’ ew.

Language Proficiency
Native speaker of Chinese and fluency in English (written and spoken). Capable of having a conversation, proficiently writing and listening to both languages.

Service and Leadership
Participated in Scouts out-of-school for around 2 years, training leadership abilities. Participated in TOUCH Homecare delivering meals to those in need.

CCAs
I partake in 2 CCAs - orchestra and coding. In the orchestra, I play the euphonium - a low brass instrument with a register similar to a trombone. Iâ€™ve performed once as an orchestra, and 2 more times previously, once as part of a quartet and a duet. In coding, we train for future hackathons by creating mock projects to work on collaboratively, developing programming prowess and my own graphic design skills.
